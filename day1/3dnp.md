# Understanding `np.ones((1, 1, 1))` in NumPy

## What is `np.ones`?
`np.ones` is a NumPy function that creates an array filled with the value 1. The shape of the array is determined by the argument passed to the function.

## Understanding the Shape Argument
The shape of a NumPy array is defined by a tuple of integers, where each integer represents the size of a dimension.

For example:
- `(3,)` creates a 1D array with 3 elements.
- `(2, 3)` creates a 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns.
- `(1, 1, 1)` creates a 3D array with 1 element in each dimension.

## What Does `np.ones((1, 1, 1))` Do?
It creates a 3-dimensional array with the shape `(1, 1, 1)`.

This means:
- The array has 1 layer (first dimension).
- Each layer has 1 row (second dimension).
- Each row has 1 column (third dimension).

The array contains only one element, which is the value 1.

## Visual Representation
The array created by `np.ones((1, 1, 1))` can be visualized as:

```python
[
    [
        [1]
    ]
]
```

- The outermost brackets represent the first dimension (1 layer).
- The middle brackets represent the second dimension (1 row).
- The innermost brackets represent the third dimension (1 column).

## Key Points
- **Shape**: The shape `(1, 1, 1)` means the array has 1 element in total.
- **Dimensions**: It is a 3D array, but all dimensions are of size 1.
- **Value**: The single element in the array is 1.

## Practical Use Case
While `np.ones((1, 1, 1))` might seem trivial, it can be useful in scenarios where:
- You need to initialize a small array for testing or debugging.
- You are working with higher-dimensional data and need a placeholder array with a specific shape.

## Example in Code
Here’s how you can create and inspect this array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create the array
arr = np.ones((1, 1, 1))

# Print the array
print(arr)

# Output:
# [[[1.]]]

# Check the shape
print(arr.shape)  # (1, 1, 1)

# Check the number of dimensions
print(arr.ndim)  # 3

# Check the total number of elements
print(arr.size)  # 1
```

## Summary
`np.ones((1, 1, 1))` creates a 3D array with a single element (1). The shape `(1, 1, 1)` indicates that each dimension has a size of 1. This is a simple but foundational concept in NumPy, especially when working with multi-dimensional arrays.

## Example 1

### Understanding the Array Shape
The shape of the array is `(10000, 1000, 1000)`. This means:

- **First Dimension (10000)**: Represents the number of layers (e.g., frames in a video or time steps in a 3D dataset).
- **Second Dimension (1000)**: Represents the number of rows in each layer.
- **Third Dimension (1000)**: Represents the number of columns in each row.

So, this is a 3-dimensional array with:
- 10,000 layers,
- Each layer has 1,000 rows,
- Each row has 1,000 columns.

### Calculating the Total Size of the Array
The total size of the array is the total number of elements it contains. This is calculated by multiplying the sizes of all dimensions:

```
Total Size = Dimension 1 × Dimension 2 × Dimension 3
```

For this array:

```
Total Size = 10000 × 1000 × 1000 = 10,000,000,000 elements
```

### Understanding the Memory Footprint
Each element in the array is a 64-bit floating-point number by default (unless specified otherwise). Let’s calculate the memory required to store this array.

- **Size of One Element**: A 64-bit float occupies 8 bytes of memory.
- **Total Memory Required**:

```
Total Memory = Total Size × Size of One Element
Total Memory = 10,000,000,000 × 8 bytes = 80,000,000,000 bytes
```

Converting to Human-Readable Units:

- 80,000,000,000 bytes is equivalent to:
  - 80,000 MB (megabytes),
  - 80 GB (gigabytes).

# How to Choose `threads_per_worker` in a Dask Cluster?

Choosing the right `threads_per_worker` value depends on the type of workload (CPU-bound vs. IO-bound) and the hardware available. Here’s a detailed guide to help you make the right choice.

## 1. Understanding `threads_per_worker`

Each worker node in Dask can run multiple threads. The setting:

```python
threads_per_worker = X
```

determines how many parallel threads each worker will execute.

### Key Formula:

```text
Total threads = n_workers * threads_per_worker
```

This determines the total number of execution threads.

## 2. Choosing `threads_per_worker` Based on Workload Type

| Workload Type | Best `threads_per_worker` | Why? |
|---------------|---------------------------|------|
| **CPU-bound** (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Dask Array) | 1 (or max 2) | CPU-heavy tasks don’t benefit from threading due to GIL. |
| **IO-bound** (e.g., file reading, web scraping, Dask Bag, network calls) | >2 (e.g., 4 or 8) | IO tasks release GIL, allowing more threads to run. |
| **Mixed workload** (Some CPU + Some IO, e.g., Dask DataFrame) | 1-4 | Balance between compute and IO efficiency. |

## 3. Practical Recommendations Based on Hardware

| Machine Specs | Recommended Config (`n_workers × threads_per_worker`) | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **4 Cores / 8 Threads** | `n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=1` | Full CPU utilization for compute-heavy workloads. |
| **8 Cores / 16 Threads** | `n_workers=8, threads_per_worker=1` | Ideal for Dask Arrays and DataFrames. |
| **16 Cores / 32 Threads** | `n_workers=8, threads_per_worker=2` | Some workloads (e.g., ML) benefit from slight threading. |
| **Cloud/VM with limited resources** | `n_workers=2, threads_per_worker=4` | If fewer workers are allowed, increase threading. |

## 4. Example Configurations

### For CPU-bound (Dask Array, NumPy, ML)

```python
from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster

cluster = LocalCluster(n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=1, memory_limit="4GB")
client = Client(cluster)
```

4 workers, 1 thread each → Best for parallel CPU computation.

### For IO-bound (Web Scraping, Dask Bag)

```python
cluster = LocalCluster(n_workers=2, threads_per_worker=8, memory_limit="8GB")
client = Client(cluster)
```

2 workers, 8 threads each → Good for handling multiple IO tasks.

### For Balanced Workloads (Dask DataFrame, ETL)

```python
cluster = LocalCluster(n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=2, memory_limit="6GB")
client = Client(cluster)
```

4 workers, 2 threads each → Handles some CPU + IO efficiently.

## 5. When to Use `processes=True` vs. `processes=False`

| Setting | Best for | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `processes=True` | CPU-heavy workloads | Runs separate memory spaces, avoids GIL issues. |
| `processes=False` | Shared-memory workloads | Faster inter-thread communication. |

### Example:

```python
cluster = LocalCluster(n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=2, processes=True)
```

- Runs 4 workers as separate processes.
- Each process has 2 threads.

## 6. Monitoring and Adjusting Performance

After setting up your cluster, monitor its performance:

```python
print(client.dashboard_link)
```

Check worker CPU and memory usage and adjust:

- If workers are idle → Increase `threads_per_worker`.
- If memory is overloaded → Reduce `threads_per_worker` or add more workers.

## Final Recommendations

- ✅ For **CPU-heavy tasks** (ML, NumPy, Pandas): `threads_per_worker=1`
- ✅ For **IO-heavy tasks** (Web scraping, reading files): `threads_per_worker=4-8`
- ✅ For **mixed workloads** (Dask DataFrame, ETL): `threads_per_worker=2-4`
